In the first assignment, I sorted three integers a, b, and c using exactly three simple if statements without any else, and, or, or elif. By swapping the variables based on their pairwise comparisons (a > b, a > c, b > c), I arranged them in ascending order. This exercise demonstrated how to perform sorting with minimal conditional logic. Through this, we explored basic methods for comparing numbers and swapping variable values. I learned how to arrange numbers in ascending order with minimal operations.

In the second assignment, I created a list containing elements of various data types. By using a loop and the type() function to check the type of each element, I learned how to efficiently handle and analyze mixed data. The use of a counter was key to keeping track of the results. This task reinforced the use of loops and type checking in Python to process and analyze data within collections.
